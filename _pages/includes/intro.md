I received my Ph.D. from Northwestern Polytechnical University under the supervision of Prof. Feiping Nie. My research primarily focuses on unsupervised, trustworthy and resource-efficient representation learning, covering multi-view learning, graph learning, federated learning, clustering and anomaly detection. Some of my work has been accepted or published in  leading journals and conferences, such as TPAMI, TIP, TKDE and IJCAI.
